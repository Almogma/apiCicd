# User-Guide : Web API using TDD and CICD
This project is part of academic course - Project management in [SCE - Shamoon College of Engineering](https://sce.ac.il).

This project is an example for interacting with an external web API using TDD and CICD development methods.
It includes two features that interact with the “themoviedb” API and output a filtered list.
One is a list of movies, sorted by popularity and adhere to given date parameters,
The other is a similar array of movie titles, this time sorted by user rankings.
Each feature is built with five test cases in mind, with each case testing a specific aspect of the feature.
